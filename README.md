# Mask Smart Contract Configurations

This repository contains some common configurations for smart contract projects. Before you deploy a smart contract or interact with a smart contract, you need to set up your wallet private key, [`infura`](https://infura.io/) key, and [`etherscan api key`](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics) in `.env`. `.env.example` is a template, which contains dummy configurations. Please handle your secrets carefully. In this project, `.env` has already been added into `.gitignore`.
