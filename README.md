# Mask Smart Contract Configurations

This repository contains some common configurations for smart contract projects. Before you deploy a smart contract or interact with a smart contract, you need to set up your wallet private key and [`infura`](https://infura.io/) key in `project.secret.json`. `project.secret.sample.json` is a template, which contains dummy configurations. Please handle your secrets carefully. In this project, `project.secret.json` has already been added into `.gitignore`.
